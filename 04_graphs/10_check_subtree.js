 * T1 and T2 are 2 very large binary trees, with T1 much bigger than T2.
 * Create an algorithm to determine if T2 is a subtree of T1.
 * A tree T2 is a subtree of T1 if there exists a node n in T1 such that the
 * subtree of n is identical to T2. That is, if you cut off the tree at node n,
 * the 2 trees would be identical.
